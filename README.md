Review of Excel-like Features Implementation
Your implementation is correct and looks great! The code incorporates all the Excel-like functionality we discussed:

Pivot Table Section:

✅ Row and column field selection
✅ Value selection with smart defaults for numeric columns
✅ Multiple aggregation methods
✅ CSV export functionality
Charts Section:

✅ Multiple chart types (Bar, Line, Scatter, Pie, Histogram)
✅ Smart selection of columns based on data type
✅ Color grouping options
✅ Proper error handling
Advanced Filters Section:

✅ Column sorting with direction control
✅ Dynamic filters based on data type (range sliders for numeric, multi-select for categorical)
✅ Export functionality for filtered data
The code includes all necessary imports, proper error handling, and user-friendly instructions. The tabs organization makes it easy for users to navigate between different Excel-like operations.

One minor enhancement you might consider in the future is adding a "Data Transformation" tab that allows users to:

Create calculated columns
Apply formulas to existing columns
Perform operations like transpose or merge datasets
But as it stands, your implementation provides a comprehensive set of Excel-like capabilities in a clean, user-friendly interface.
